### Part 5: Your First Task - Example Workflow (30 minutes)

Let's walk through a complete example of fixing a bug using Claude Code.

#### Example Bug: "Download button not working on mobile"

**Step 1: Open Claude Code**
```bash
# Make sure you're in project directory
cd ~/Documents/tutorbot-plus

# Start Claude
claude
```

**Step 2: Use the /bug command**

In Claude Code, type:
```
/bug
```

Claude will ask: "Now, please describe the bug you're experiencing."

**You respond:**
```
The download button for portraits doesn't work on mobile devices. When I tap it, nothing happens. It works fine on desktop.
```

**Step 3: Claude investigates**

Claude will:
1. Ask clarifying questions (answer them)
2. Search the codebase for download-related code
3. Check for mobile-specific issues
4. Identify the root cause

**Example questions Claude might ask:**
- "What browser are you testing on mobile? (Safari, Chrome, Firefox?)"
- "Do you see any errors in the browser console?"
- "Does the button visually respond to taps (like a click animation)?"

**Step 4: Claude proposes a fix**

Claude will show you the code change, like:

```tsx
// Found the issue in: components/portraits/PortraitCard.tsx

// The problem:
<button onClick={handleDownload}>
  Download
</button>

// The fix:
<button
  onClick={handleDownload}
  onTouchEnd={handleDownload}  // Added for mobile support
>
  Download
</button>
```

**Step 5: Claude tests the fix**

Claude will:
- Apply the fix
- Run TypeScript check
- Run ESLint
- Run product quality checks
- Test the functionality

**Step 6: You verify**

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser's mobile view:
1. Press F12 (DevTools)
2. Click the mobile icon (top left)
3. Test the download button
4. Verify it works!

**Step 7: Review and commit**

Back in Claude Code:
```
/review
```

Claude will review the changes for:
- Code quality
- Security
- Design system compliance
- Accessibility

If everything passes:
```bash
# In terminal (not Claude Code)
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Download button now works on mobile devices

- Added onTouchEnd handler for mobile touch events
- Tested on mobile view
- All quality checks pass
"
```

## 🎨 Design System

TutorBot Plus uses a **warm, playful, pet-friendly** design system:

### Colors (ONLY use these!)
- **Primary**: Coral `#FF7F50` - Warm and inviting
- **Secondary**: Rose `#F43F5E` - Soft and loving
- **Accent**: Lime `#84CC16` - Fresh and vibrant

### Never Use
❌ Indigo, Blue, Purple (except for specific accent cases)
❌ Arbitrary color values like `bg-[#FF0000]`

### Styling Rules
- Very rounded corners: `rounded-2xl` or `rounded-3xl` (16-32px)
- Soft warm shadows with coral tints
- Playful animations (bounce, wiggle, heart pulse)
- Generous spacing for cozy experience

### Check Your Code
Run product quality checks to ensure design system compliance:

```bash
npm run lint:product
```

---

## 👥 Human-in-the-Loop System

TutorBot Plus implements a Human-in-the-Loop approach where certain portraits can be assigned to human executors for manual review or enhancement.

### How It Works

1. **AI Generation First**: All portraits are initially generated by AI
2. **Quality Check**: Portraits can be flagged for human review if quality is questionable
3. **Executor Assignment**: Portraits can be assigned to human executors (professional artists/retouchers)
4. **Manual Enhancement**: Human executor improves the portrait
5. **Delivery**: Enhanced portrait is returned to the user

### For Developers

When implementing features related to portrait generation:

- Check `Portrait` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` for executor assignment fields
- API routes in `app/api/portraits/` handle executor workflow
- Dashboard includes executor management (future feature)

---

## 🔒 Security Rules

### Never Commit
❌ API keys or secrets
❌ `.env` files
❌ Database credentials
❌ User data or test data with PII

### Always
✅ Use Zod validation for all API inputs
✅ Check authentication before sensitive operations
✅ Validate file uploads strictly
✅ Use TypeScript types (no `any`)
✅ Handle errors gracefully
